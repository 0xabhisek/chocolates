Exploratory Data Analysis with Conditional Formatting (CF)
This project demonstrates how to leverage Conditional Formatting in Excel to gain insights from sales data. Three approaches are explored to highlight trends, outliers, and performance indicators.

üìä Objective
Enhance data visibility through color coding and conditional rules.
Understand high sales with fewer units, identify top performers, and explore duplicate or critical values.
üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed
1. Color Scales
Applied Conditional Formatting ‚Üí Color Scales to the "Amount" column.
Visualized data trends by zooming out for better insights.
2. Top/Bottom Rules
Highlighted values:
Greater than average
Top 10 items in the "Amount" column.
Sorted units to reveal high sales with fewer units.
3. Highlight Cells
Identified duplicate values for analysis.
Sorted by preference to analyze patterns.
